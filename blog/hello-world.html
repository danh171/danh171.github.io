          <h1 class="post-heading">Hello, World!</h1>

          <p><em>This first post will act as an icebreaker, for me in writing these posts, and you in reading them. I intend for these posts to have a casual, conversational tone, as if I was having a (albeit completely one-sided), chat with somebody</em></p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">Why I Made this Site</h2>
          <p>I've always had in my head that making a website was a "rite of passage" for a software developer. Even though I've always leaned more towards backend web technologies, it's clear that having a greater understanding of the entire web stack has its benefits.</p>

          <p>So I decided to make this website for two main reasons:</p>

          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><p>To act as an archive, (via the blog posts), for the personal projects I'll be working on. I hope that this will motivate me to stick with the projects I start and see them through.</p></li>
            <li><p>To help anyone out there who may be looking for some info on a particular topic. I picture my past self looking up some, possibly esoteric, CS-related question. After some initial scanning of the search results, I happen upon a well-written post on the topic and my prayers are answered. I aim to one day be the writer of such a post.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="post-heading">The Types of Posts I'll Be Writing</h2>
          <p>The posts I initially intend to write will document my experience working on personal projects that interest me. I'll structure each post like a story, with a beginning, highlighting the project's motivation, middle, detailing its implementation, and an ending, showcasing the final result.</p>

          <p>For my first few posts it will probably be one post per project. Eventually though, bigger projects may be split into a series of multiple posts.</p>

          <p>Some example projects that initially spring to mind include developing a larger blog site with user accounts, authentication, persistent storage, etc., using a framework such as Next.js, as well as some low level stuff like developing Linux device drivers, and looking into how terminal emulators work.</p>

          <p>I also want to write shorter (&lt;5 min read), tutorial style posts, chronicling things I learn that are unrelated to any of the project posts, but that I believe may be useful enough to document (for my future self, if not somebody else).</p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">Getting in Touch</h2>
          <p>In the website's footer there's a mail icon. This links to an email address that I've set up specifically for this website. The posts I publish will be far from perfect, and sooner or later I will state something that is either inaccurate or just plain wrong. If/when this happens, please feel free to drop me an email to let me know. I'd also be open to any suggestions that people may have for past or future projects.</p>

          <p>Until then &#9996;</p>
