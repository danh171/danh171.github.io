          <p><em>This post outlines the steps I took and the technical choices I made to get this site from a blank html document to the page you're viewing right now.</em></p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>I set myself the challenge of making a website from scratch using plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a couple of reasons. I wanted to dust off the cobwebs and revise the fundamentals of web development. I've worked with HTML/CSS/JS plenty of times in the past, but never really for a project where they were the sole languages used. I also wanted to experience what it would be like to build a website without using a framework to do most of the heavy lifting and abstract away a lot of the details. I hope that when I do eventually use a framework to enhance the website I'll have a greater appreciation and understanding of just how much it is doing behind the scenes for me. Also, since most of the web just boils down to HTML/CSS/JS, it's a good idea to have a sound comprehension of the trio before diving into more advanced libraries and frameworks.</p>

          <p>So with that said, I'll detail the choices I made when putting together this website, the reasoning behind them, and why some of them were not ideal. I'll go over the pages I developed, and then talk about getting the site live.</p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">The Main Layout</h2>
          <p>As I was feeling a little rusty in the frontend design department, I chose to play it safe and go with a (very) minimal theme for the site. I kept the colour scheme basic with a white background, black text, and blue (<code style="color: #127dc5;">#127dc5</code> to be exact) links.</p>

          <p>I decided to use CSS grid for developing the layout of the site. In the past, I've mainly gravitated towards flexbox, so I wanted to learn a bit more about grid, and gain some practical experience using it. I took a mobile-first approach when writing my CSS, having my default styles target smaller screen sizes, and setting a media query breakpoint at 768px to handle the tablet/desktop variant of the website. One of my aims was to keep the CSS from getting too convoluted, and I think that not getting bogged down in all the different possible breakpoints I could have gone with is helping with that.</p>

          <p>On mobile, I have a grid of 4 rows corresponding to the header, nav, main content, and footer. On desktop, there are 3 rows and 3 columns. The first column is taken up by a sidebar nav, which I have set to <code><span class="code-css-property">position</span>: fixed;</code>. The second column holds the header, main content, and footer. I used a blank third column as a bit of a hack to centre the main content.</p>

          <!-- TODO: put image of wire frame of the layout here -->

          <p>I used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a> to fix some style inconsistencies across different browsers. I did consider using something like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">CSS Reset</a>, but I find it more of a hassle having to redeclare a lot of properties whose default styling I don't mind in the first place.</p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">Fonts and Sizing</h2>
          <p>After a quick review of the myriad of different sizing units in CSS, I decided to use the <code>rem</code> as my main unit. In previous projects, I've chosen either <code>rem</code>, <code>em</code> or <code>px</code>. What swayed me in the end was this comprehensive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43131958">Stack Overflow answer</a> on the topic of units. I incorporated the following CSS suggested in the answer, that makes calculating <code>px</code>'s from <code>rem</code>'s, much handier:</p>

          <pre><code>
  <span class="code-css-selector">:root</span> {
    <span class="code-css-property">font-size</span>: 62.5%;
  }

  <span class="code-css-selector">body</span> {
    <span class="code-css-property">font-size</span>: 1.6rem;
  }
          </code></pre>

          <p>I opted to increase the body's font size on mobile to 18px (1.8rem), as opposed to 16px (1.6rem), as I found this size offered a more pleasant reading experience. I used a couple of google fonts for the website. I went with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zen+Dots">Zen Dots</a> for the site's header, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a> for everything else.</p>

          <h2 class="post-heading">The Homepage</h2>
          <p>For the site's landing page, I wanted to have a brief "About Me" section. This just contains some personal info about my education and professional experience. The contents of this page are likely to change to reflect any updates in my professional experience.</p>
